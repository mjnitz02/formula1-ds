## Formula1 Python Modeling Framework
For experimental purposes I am developing a set of tools and models designed around ingesting formula 1 data for the purposes of attempting to predict various race events that may happen in subsequent races. This repo is purely for fun and is somewhat meant as a means of experimenting with pytorch functionality.

The ultimate goal is to also feature some additional tested utilities for retrieving and handling data, pre-processing the data, and post-training for providing a way of easily deploying predictions.
